# Foundation for Sites Template

## Manual Setup

To manually set up the template, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/martynbiz/stiracuk projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `gulp` to ensure that the compiler is working without errors. Run
`gulp watch` so that the compiler re-runs every time you save a scss/js file.
